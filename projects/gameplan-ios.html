          <h3>What is Game Plan?</h3>
          <p>Game Plan is an iOS app that allows students, alumni, and Longhorn fans at UT to connect with one another on game days.</p>
          <p>Game Plan does away with the hassle of hosting a tailgate or party. Simply drop a pin on the map, enter some information about your event, and invite your friends! Set the privacy of your event so only who you want gets invited to the event.</p>
          <p>Game Plan makes finding an event just as easy. Browse our map interface or search for an event that has what you're looking for (free food, live music, etc.) and coordinate with your friends then and there. No more annoying group texts or wandering around asking "What do you want to do?" "I don't know, what do you want to do?" Game Plan lets you spend less time planning and more time having a good time.</p>

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>I am one of two developers who works on Game Plan. It was the first iOS app either of us ever worked on, and we taught ourselves by doing, watching tutorials, and Googling like crazy. I mainly worked on the social API and backend integration. We use Facebook's Graph API and the Parse SDK to auth users and store data. Parse is really nice and simple, and works at the scale for which we are currently building.</p> 
          <p>Game Plan is far from the most robust technical app you'll find on the app store, but we'd like to think it was a decent first attempt. It has helped me gain proficiency in Objective-C and iOS Development as a whole.</p>

          <h3>A Little More...</h3>
          <p>Game Plan was also invited to participate in Longhorn Startup for the Fall 2014 semester by Bob Metcalfe, Ben Dyer and Joshua Baer. We are extremely excited for the opportunity to get time and guidance to actively work on Game Plan, and hope to be shipping more features on a regular basis. Stay tuned for web and Android soon, as well as more markets!</p>
