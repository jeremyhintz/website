          <h3>The Assignment</h3>

          <p>An Austin company is making a digital piano, drum and percussion synthesizer, and they have hired you to write the software. Since musicians are not always good programmers, the input language that is used to specify a music pattern needs to be simple. The software needs to convert the specified pattern into a time sequence of I/O commands to drive the synthesizer units. Since music is a language, we expect that a music program will be structured as a tree.</p>

          <p>The synthesizer driver program is implemented as a discrete-event simulator, based on a PriorityQueue.</p>

          <p>A discrete-event simulator processes a sequence of events which are scheduled at particular clock times. The PriorityQueue is used to hold the pending events, with the priority being the time at which an event is scheduled to occur. In operation, the simulator removes the highest-priority (smallest time value) event from the queue, sets the current time to the time of the event, and executes it; the event will typically perform some action, and it may schedule other events for the future. The simulation stops if the queue becomes empty.</p>

          <p>We will assume that time values are integers. Events that occur at the same integer time are considered to be simultaneous, regardless of their order, since the computer is much faster than the music output. A time duration of 1 represents a 1/16 note duration.</p>

          <p>An Event has a scheduled .time() and an .action(); this class is provided. An action is a list, consisting of a command followed by parameters; usually there is only one parameter, the length of time the command lasts. An event is added to the queue by the call addevent(PriorityQueue pq, Cons action, int time).</p>

          <p>Execution of a command may emit an I/O command to the synthesizer. Write a function execute(PriorityQueue pq, Cons act, int time) that executes an action by emitting appropriate commands.</p>
