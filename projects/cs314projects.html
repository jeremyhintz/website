      <h1>Data Structures</h1>
      <h2>Projects for CS 314: Data Structures</h2>

      <div id="content">

          <h3>Class Overview</h3>
          <p>CS 314 covers methods for storing large amounts of data in data structures, the algorithms used to efficiently access and manipulate that data, and analysis of the performance of the algorithms. Only the interesting projects are described here for brevity.</p>

          <h3>Trees and Symbolic Algebra</h3>
          <p>In this project, we wrote a recursive function solve(Cons e, String v) that attempted to solve an equation e for variable v. We assumed that any variable occured at most once in e, and that the equation initially had a left-hand side that was a single variable. The basic idea of solve was to test for equations that were already solved or unsolvable (base cases); otherwise, solve would search for a solution by applying laws of algebra to transform the equation into different forms. solve() is a kind of tree recursion -- not recursion on first and rest, but recursion on the applicable transformations of the input formula into new formulas. We were given the following physics functions to start with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(= s (* 0.5 (* a (exp t 2))))</li>
            <li>(= s (+ s0 (* v t)))</li>
            <li>(= a (/ f m))</li>
            <li>(= v (* a t))</li>
            <li>(= f (/ (* m v) t))</li>
            <li>(= f (/ (* m (exp v 2)) r))</li>
            <li>(= h (- h0 (* 4.94 (exp t 2))))</li>
            <li>(= c (sqrt (+ (exp a 2) (exp b 2))))</li>
            <li>(= v (* v0 (- 1 (exp (/ (- t) (* r c))))))</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We were then given physics problems and asked to write formulas that would solve them.</p>

          <h3>Memos and Music</h3>
          <p>In this project, we were asked to write software for a synthesizer that would play songs by using a few commands that could be strung together in a tree pattern and played back using JFugue.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>(rest d) does not emit anything, but has a time duration of d.</li>
            <li>(boom d) emits a bass_drum command.</li>
            <li>(snare d) emits a snare drum command.</li>
            <li>(hat d) emits a high-hat cymbal command.</li>
            <li>(cymbal d) emits a crash cymbal command.</li>
            <li>(cowbell d) emits a cowbell command.</li>
            <li>(bell d) emits a ride bell command.</li>
            <li>(clap d) emits a hand clap command.</li>
            <li>(tambourine d) multiplies its duration by a random number, obtained by calling random.nextDouble(); if the integer result is > 2, it schedules tambourine again with that amount as its duration, at the current time plus current duration minus that amount. It emits a command with a duration of 2 immediately. (This random behavior simulates a tambourine player who smokes way too much weed).</li>
            <li>(seq action1 ... actionn) schedules each of its actions to execute in sequence, one after the other. seq thus makes a sequence of multiple actions look like a single action. seq could either schedule all of its actions at once, starting with the current time and adding the time of each action, or it could schedule the first action and schedule a seq for the rest of the actions.</li>
            <li>(sync action1 ... actionn) schedules each of its actions for the current time. sync represents synchronized execution of multiple subprograms.</li>
            <li>(repeat n action) schedules n events with the specified action. The first of these n events will happen at the same time that repeat executes (i.e. simultaneously with repeat). One way to accomplish this is to schedule the action immediately; then if n > 1, schedule (repeat n-1 action) for the current time plus the time of the action. Alternatively, repeat could simply schedule all n events at once; this would use more queue space if n is large.</li>
            <li>(piano voice note d) emits a piano command using the function emitp(voice, note, time, d). A note is a string such as "C". A note may specify an octave, such as "C5", and the note letter may be followed by "#" or "b" for sharp and flat. voice is an integer from 0 to 3.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Do You Know the Way to <strike>San Jose</strike> Muleshoe?</h3>
          <p>Even Dijkstra's algorithm is bigger in Texas. In this assignment, we looked at graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and A* search. We applied them to map traversal like what is done on Google Maps, where the nodes are the cities of Texas and the edges are highways with a weight given by their relative distances.</p>

          <h3>MapReduce</h3>
          <p>In this assignment, we learned the basics of MapReduce programming. MapReduce is used by Google for much of their processing of large data sets (terabytes of data). Hadoop is an open-source version of MapReduce written in Java; it is available to commercial users through Amazon Web Services. For this assignment, we used a simplified version of MapReduce; the way in which it is programmed is similar to Hadoop.</p>
