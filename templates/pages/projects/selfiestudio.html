      <h1>Selfie Studio</h1>
      <h2>An App That Helps You Take Better Selfies</h2>

          <h3>Motivation for the App</h3>
          <p>The inspiration for this app comes from an article I read that I thought was ridiculous, that said that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2510418/One-Brits-SEVEN-selfies-satisfied-captured-perfect-shot-thirds-hair-make-beforehand.html">people can take up to seven selfies before they find one they like</a>. But when I brought it up to my 18-year old sister, she not only didn't think it was ridiciulous, but also counted herself among those who often take a myriad of selfies in the hopes of finding the perfect one.</p>
          <p>After hearing that, I continued to research and found the following equally as seemingly absurd statistics:</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>50% of young women take three selfies a day</li>
            <li>Each selfie session lasts 48 minutes and includes applying make-up, getting the right lighting and perfecting angles</li>
            <li>81% of selfiers ask a friend to help decide if their selfie is good</li>
            <li>27% of young women delete selfies within minutes if they havenâ€™t gotten enough likes on social media</li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>With this motivation, I decided to make Selfie Studio.</p>

          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>Selfie Studio is an Android App that aims to solve the problems listed above. It does this by allowing users to take selfies on their Android phone and then uses various computer vision techniques to compare those selfies to those which they have already uploaded to social media. If the new picture is more similar to frequently-liked photos, then Selfie Studio labels the photo as "Bae" or good. If the new picture is more similar to existing photos with only a few likes, then Selfie Studio labels the photo as "Ratchet." And if it is somewhere in the middle, it is labeled "Basic." After the photo has been rated, the user can choose to upload it to social media or try again.</p>

          <h3>Technical Aspects</h3>
          <p>This was my first Android app, so learning the ecosystem and the ins and outs of Android Studio and Android development as a whole were a slight challenge. Another portion of time was spent working with the Facebook OpenGraph API. I hadn't worked with the API since v2, and I found v4 had much less to offer. Because of all the restrictions Facebook had put on user information, getting what I needed took more effort than anticipated. 
          <p>The main technical challenges, however, came from implementing a computer vision algorithm that was smart enough to know what made two images similar. This is the main portion of the app that I am still working on, and I will update this page when I feel I have something sustantial. Stay tuned!</p>
