            <h2>Breaking Down Twitter&#39;s Upcoming IPO</h2>
            <h6>Published November 5, 2013</h6>
            <p>Twitter&#39;s IPO is getting closer every day, with most analysts predicting it will fall within the week. People have not forgotten Facebook&#39;s woeful IPO which saw the stock&#39;s price drop to levels roughly 50% of their initial offering. However, YTD Facebook is up over 200% since the beginning of June, and that recent success has created buzz for the potential of social media and tech IPO&#39;s in general. </p>
            <p>Investors are getting characteristically overly optimistic about Twitter&#39;s prospects as a publicly traded stock. Let&#39;s highlight some key differences between Facebook and Twitter.</p>
            <p>The most obvious distinction is revenue and profit. Through the first three quarters of 2013, Twitter had revenue of $422 million, compared to Facebook&#39;s $5.287 billion. While Facebook had net income of $977 million, Twitter netted losses of $134 million. The difference in revenue is to some degree expected: Facebook has roughly five times Twitter&#39;s users. However, at $1.72, Facebook also earns over twice as much per user than Twitter at $0.73.</p>
            <p>Luckily for Twitter, investors rarely judge tech companies on their profit potential, but rather growth potential. For instance, Amazon has almost flatly refused to be in the black throughout its short yet illustrious history. Quarter after quarter, they reinvest all their revenue back into the business to create growth and investors follow suit. The problem is Twitter going public will put pressure on the company to search out new sources of revenue by monetizing some of its core features. Depending on how these changes sit with users, they could affect Twitter&#39;s growth rate, which is what investors are attracted to in the first place.</p>
            <p>A growth plateau seems likely for Twitter, given the way it has mostly appealed to the young upper and middle-class. That doesn&#39;t seem bad at first: nearly all start-ups have a core base of targeted users to begin with and expand to other groups over time. This is different because it would be hard to imagine it was the founders&#39;s intention, at least not consciously. The result makes sense at a surface level: young and affluent Americans have the most access to technology, so it&#39;s easier for them to tweet. But access to the internet and mobile devices is growing extremely quickly in the demographics that fall outside of young and rich, and Twitter&#39;s growth is not even close to keeping pace. It&#39;s hard to know whether this will change in the near or long term, but the IPO and subsequent pressure to monetize make it more likely that growth will indeed become an issue.</p>
            <p>For perspective, $1000 invested in Google&#39;s IPO just 9 years ago would be worth $14,165 today. The same amount invested in Amazon would have yielded $19,831. Investors in LinkedIn have seen their money quintuple in just a year and a half.</p>
            <p>Buying into Twitter, like any investment, comes with substantial risk. But regardless of the potential pitfalls the company faces, the potential is hard to ignore.</p>
